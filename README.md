Description
-----------
This control panel will use mecanical interface such as buttons and rotary encoders to send keyboard shortcuts via USB using a Teensy 3.5 board. These shortcuts are configured in Phase One Capture One Pro 10 to do adjustment on images like contrast or exposition.


Hardware used
-------------
This is not the list of final hardware, prototyping state only for now.
  - Teensy 3.5 (comparable to Arduino but with fast 32bits microcontroller, compact form factor, HID support and tons of IO)
  - Rotary Encoder from elecfreaks.com
  - Several dip switches
  - Breadboard
